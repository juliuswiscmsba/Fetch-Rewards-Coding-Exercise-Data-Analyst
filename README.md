# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise-Data Analyst

In this exercise, I worked with the brands.json, users.json, and receipts.json to build a New Structured Relational Data Model, write queries to answers predetermined questions from a business stakeholder, evaluate Data Quality Issues, and communicate with Stakeholders.

1. Review unstructured JSON data and diagram a new structured relational data model -> ER Diagram.pdf
2. Generate a query that answers a predetermined business question -> SQL query.pdf (MySQL)
3. Capture data quality issues against the new structured relational data model -> DQ_users.ipynb, DQ_brands.ipynb, DQ_receipts.ipynb
4. Write a short email or Slack message to the business stakeholder -> Communicate with Stakeholders Email.pdf
